# Box-Packer-Using-Greedy-Algorithm

This program simulates packing books of varying weights into boxes. The greedy algorithm is used and will find a reasonably cost efficient packing order.
The program runs by recieving a book order file and a box configuration file. 
The program will calculate and print out its packing list to the console.
